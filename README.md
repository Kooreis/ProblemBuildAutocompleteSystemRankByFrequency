# Question: How do you build an autocomplete system that ranks suggestions by frequency of use? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a console application that implements an autocomplete system using a Trie data structure. The Trie data structure is used for efficient search and retrieval of words. Each node of the Trie stores a character, a flag to indicate the end of a word, and a count of the frequency of the word. The application includes methods to insert words into the Trie, search for a word, delete a word, and suggest words based on a given prefix. The insert method increases the count each time a word is inserted, allowing the system to track the frequency of use of each word. The suggest method returns a list of words that start with a given prefix, sorted by their frequency of use. The suggestionsRecursively method is a helper method that recursively finds all words in the Trie that start with a given prefix. This solution effectively ranks suggestions by frequency of use, providing a more relevant autocomplete system.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. Instead of using a Trie data structure, it uses a Map to store sentences and their frequencies. This approach is simpler and more straightforward, but it may not be as efficient as the Trie approach when dealing with a large number of words.

The TypeScript version also introduces type annotations, which is a feature not available in JavaScript. Type annotations in TypeScript provide a way to enforce certain types of values to variables, function parameters, and function return values. This can help catch potential bugs at compile time.

In the TypeScript version, the `inputChar` method is used to handle user input. It updates the current input and returns the top 3 suggestions based on the frequency and lexicographical order. If the input character is '#', it means the current input is finished and its frequency is increased by 1. This is a different approach compared to the JavaScript version, where the `suggest` method is used to return a list of suggestions for a given prefix.

The TypeScript version also uses the `Array.from` method to create an array from the Map keys, and the `Array.prototype.filter` method to filter out the keys that start with the current input. These methods are not used in the JavaScript version.

In conclusion, the TypeScript version provides a simpler and more straightforward solution to the problem, but it may not be as efficient as the JavaScript version when dealing with a large number of words. The TypeScript version also introduces type annotations and uses different methods to handle user input and generate suggestions.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the autocomplete system is similar to the JavaScript version in that it uses a Trie data structure for efficient search and retrieval of words. The Trie nodes also store a frequency count for each word to rank suggestions by frequency of use. However, there are some differences in the implementation and language features used.

1. Object-Oriented Programming: Both versions use classes and objects, but the C++ version uses more advanced features of object-oriented programming. For example, it uses a constructor to initialize the Trie with a list of sentences and their frequencies. It also uses private and public access specifiers to control the visibility of members.

2. Data Structures: The JavaScript version uses JavaScript objects (which are essentially hash maps) to store the children of each Trie node. The C++ version uses an unordered_map, which is a hash table data structure provided by the C++ Standard Library.

3. Sorting: The JavaScript version uses the built-in sort function with a custom comparator to sort the suggestions by frequency. The C++ version also uses a custom comparator, but it is defined as a struct. It also uses the sort function from the C++ Standard Library.

4. Memory Management: In the C++ version, new Trie nodes are created using the new keyword, which allocates memory on the heap. This memory must be manually deallocated to prevent memory leaks. The JavaScript version does not require manual memory management.

5. Input/Output: The C++ version uses the input function to add words to the Trie and get suggestions. It also uses the standard output stream (cout) to print the suggestions. The JavaScript version uses the insert and suggest methods to add words and get suggestions, and it uses console.log to print the suggestions.

6. String Manipulation: The C++ version uses the + operator to concatenate characters to strings. The JavaScript version uses the charAt method to get a character from a string and the + operator to concatenate strings.

7. The C++ version limits the number of suggestions to 3, while the JavaScript version does not limit the number of suggestions.
